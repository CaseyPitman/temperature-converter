# temperature-converter
A web app to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin. 

JavaScript

This was the first JavaScript app I built on my own. I wanted to show the temperature in all three major temperature scales regardless of which scale was used for the input. It took me a few days to put all the logic together. I was learning as I went. The image and background vary depending on what season of the year it is when the app is accessed.
